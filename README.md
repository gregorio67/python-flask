# python-flask

This project is web service using python flask.
I think python flask looks like java spring framework.
It is easier than django to develope web service with python.

In order to python flask, install flask with (python -m)pip install flask command in your command screen.

To develop web page with html, you should make sub folder named templates in your package.
The template folder should be placeed with html files.

And also you make sub folder named static in your package.
The static folder contains css, java scripts, images and so on.

In this project use sqlite3 for data processing in the web service.
In db package has DBUtil python file with sqlite class.
The sqlite class provide db connection, insert, select method.
